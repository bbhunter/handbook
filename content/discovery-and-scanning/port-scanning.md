# Port Scanning

Let's continue narrowing down our attack vector. It is time now to grab your host or list of hosts and scan for open ports and running services.  
Port scanners can be categorized between **synchronous or connection-oriented** and **asynchronous or connectionless**.  
Synchronous scanners, like [Nmap](https://nmap.org/), wait for a host response (until the timeout period expires) to determine if the port it's alive. This translates to slower scans, especially on big network ranges, but an accurate port discovery in comparison with connectionless scanners.  
Asynchronous scanners like [scanrad](http://www.vulnerabilityassessment.co.uk/scanrand.htm), [zmap](https://github.com/zmap/zmap), or [masscan](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan), on the other hand, don't wait for a host response as they create separate threads for each port. This allows a high-speed scan, but less accurate since they cannot detect dropped packets.  
Combining both tools could help you find a balance between speed and accuracy for each engagement. [^captmeelo-benchmark]

## Network Sweep

### masscan [^masscan]

```sh
sudo masscan -p 7,9,13,21-23,25-26,37,53,79-81,88,106,110-111,113,119,135,139,143-144,179,199,389,427,443-445,465,513-515,543-544,548,554,587,631,646,873,990,993,995,1025-1029,1110,1433,1720,1723,1755,1900,2000-2001,2049,2121,2717,3000,3128,3306,3389,3986,4899,5000,5009,5051,5060,5101,5190,5357,5432,5631,5666,5800,5900,6000-6001,6646,7070,8000,8008-8009,8080-8081,8443,8888,9100,9999-10000,32768,49152-49157 --rate 50000 --wait 0 --open-only -oG masscan.gnmap {{< param "m.RCIDR" >}} 
```

{{<details "Parameters">}}
- `-p <ports>`: port(s) to be scanned.
- `--rate <rate>`: rate for transmitting packets (packet per seconds).
- `--wait <seconds>`: seconds after transmit is done to wait for receiving packets before exiting. Default 10 seconds.
- `--open-only`: report only open ports.
- `-oG <filename>`: output scan in grepable format to the given filename.

## Host Scan

### TCP Scan

This is a good all-purpose initial scan. Scans the most common 1000 ports with service information (`-sV`), default scripts (`-sC`), and OS detection.

{{<hint info>}}
Verbose mode (`-v`) not only provides the estimated time for each host, but, it also prints the results as it goes letting you continue with the reconnaissance while scanning.
{{</hint>}}

```sh
sudo nmap -v -sV -sC -O -T4 -n -Pn -oA nmap_scan {{< param "m.RHOST" >}}
```

Similar scan but scans all ports, from 1 through 65535.

```sh
sudo nmap -v -sV -sC -O -T4 -n -Pn -p- -oA nmap_fullscan {{< param "m.RHOST" >}}
```

### UDP Scan

During a UDP scan (`-Su`) `-sV` will send protocol-specific probes, also known as _nmap-service-probes_, to every `open|filtered` port. In case of response the state change to `open`. [^nmap-udp]

```sh
sudo nmap -sU -sV --version-intensity 0 -n {{< param "m.RCIDR" >}}
```

### Enumeration Scan

In addition to the default scripts that run with `-sC` or `--script=default`, NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine), provides [multiple types and categories](https://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html#nse-script-selection) to select from. 

It is a common practice to combine the list of ports resulting from a network sweep or a fast nmap scan like:

```sh
nmap -T4 -Pn -n {{< param "m.RHOST" >}}
```
with a more extensive scan against those ports.

```sh
sudo nmap -v -sV -O --script="safe and vuln" -T4 -n -Pn -p135,445 -oA nmap_scan {{< param "m.RHOST" >}}
```

The `--script` parameter is extremely flexible and full features, refer to the [documentation](https://nmap.org/book/nse.html) for more about NSE.

{{<hint danger>}}
Never run scripts from third parties unless you trust the authors or have carefully audited the scripts yourself.
{{</hint>}}

{{<details "Parameters">}}
- `-v`: verbose mode.
- `-sU`: UDP scan.
- `-sV`: determine service/version info.
- `-sC`: performs a script scan.
- `-O`: enable OS detection.
- `-p <port ranges>`: scan specific ports.
- `--open`: only show open ports.
- `-Pn`: no ping.
- `-n`: no DNS resolution.
- `-T<0-5>`: timing template.
- `oX <filename>`: output scan in XML format to the given filename.
- `--version-intensity 0`: try only the probes most likely to be effective.
{{</details>}}

## Miscellaneous

### List all Nmap scripts categories

```sh
grep -r categories /usr/share/nmap/scripts/*.nse | grep -oP '".*?"' | sort -u
```

### List Nmap scripts for a specific category

List scripts under the `default` category.

```sh
grep -r categories /usr/share/nmap/scripts/*.nse | grep default | cut -d: -f1
```
